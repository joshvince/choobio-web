# Commuter Web App

This app uses the [Commuter service](https://www.github.com/joshvince/commuter)
to provide additional data about the London Underground.  

Currently, this app provides a summary of the last hour's service statuses for each Tube line. The Trains feature, which will assign a score to trains based on how quiet they are, is in development.  

## To install this app
- Clone this repo
- Install packages with `npm i`
- Start the development server with `npm start`
- The server will be running at port `3000`
